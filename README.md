# Money Model Calculator

A powerful web-based calculator for evaluating business models based on Alex Hormozi's $100M Offers framework. This tool helps entrepreneurs determine if their business model can scale profitably by calculating whether profit from 1 customer can pay for acquiring 2+ more customers within 30 days.

## üìä Features

### Core Calculator
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** calculation including ad spend, sales costs, and overhead
- **Value Ladder Analysis** with attraction offers, upsells, downsells, and continuity programs
- **Take Rate Modeling** for realistic conversion projections
- **30-Day Cash Flow Analysis** to determine business model health

- **CSV Export**: Download your calculations for further analysis

## üéØ Key Metrics

The calculator determines your "Customers Paid For" ratio - the core metric showing how many new customers your profit from one customer can acquire. A ratio of 2.0+ indicates a scalable business model.

## üí° How It Works

1. **Input Your Numbers**: Enter your CAC, offer revenues, costs, and take rates
2. **Review Results**: See your 30-day profit, cash multiplier, and business health status
3. **Analyze Breakdown**: Use the cost breakdown tool to itemize expenses
4. **Project Growth**: Visualize how your business scales over 12-36 months
5. **Export Data**: Download CSV for detailed analysis or presentations

## üìñ Understanding the Money Model

The Money Model concept from Alex Hormozi's $100M Offers focuses on creating a self-funding growth engine:

- **Core Principle**: Your business should generate enough profit from 1 customer to pay for acquiring 2+ more customers within 30 days
- **Why 30 Days?**: Cash flow timing is critical for reinvestment and scaling
- **Why 2.0+ Ratio?**: One pays back your acquisition cost, the additional customers fuel exponential growth
